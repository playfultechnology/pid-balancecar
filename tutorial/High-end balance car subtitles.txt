下面我们讲解下如何设置小车从会看
到小车游行模电实践行光电特别是一
个白色充电接口在测试服务器使用然
后但是我们相处也是这样个层面浇头
是个黄片不能和这边的排阵进行接触
或者可能会引起网路然后这边是一个
梯形教果然后主要是用于辨识小车的
宫殿的慢慢的这个主板上的屁股上面
这一定要慢慢长然后长期之后我们会
看到这边有个组开关拨到这个时候主
板上的灯会点亮但是这个数还不能保
持我们可以通过两种方式开启屏幕比
如我们可以单击一个按键的时候就可
以再次单的英文件就可以关闭在用户
看见旁边这个是复位按键然后我们可
以按住小车前推一定要用测试推子的
然后稍微快一点点这个时候下他就可
以自动保存当我们在小车保持平和的
情况下它录小车快速的向上提起弹是
小车感应到一个较大的加速度之后然
后就会自动关闭电子然后小车上面一
个个模块就是控制器这是网页模块就
是蓝牙模块然后这是驱动器然后再是
一个电视电量测量模块这边是一个焊
接口这边是无线模块接口这边可以作
为一个难忘的一个结果这边有一些扩
展的解法然后上面我们测试驾车通过
我们把它上面的时候记住不要带电操
作锻炼时候查了这边有个视频的弹幕
上面上的时候我们就开始开始之后在
显示屏的第二行有显示有显示一些距
离但是他不能进入壁上我们需要先开
启平衡开启平安之后我们常用户按键
两秒钟我们最右上方显示的他当它吊
臂上会显示的干的拼音对会代表界杯
上模式前方有障碍物的时候前方两百
米前前方零点五米内有三个手就会往
后退如果要切换到该水模式就是前前
方有障碍物时候小车会跟随着大陆的
话我们也可以我们需要使用adb连接添
加之后我们这边找个蓝牙然后连接的
然后这边调试界面这边有个超声波攻
切换我们点击一下这时候就强了边水
在显示屏的宇航员会也会有显示我们
把小说说话前面然后他就会跟随我们
在前方有前方十厘米有毒物质后小他
就会跟随在屋前进然后我们再是长安
就换键可以退出这个可以退出这个超
声波模式就是说我们可以将想那个遥
控连接这边可以还可以显示波形显示
调试了一些参数这边还有个斜坡形成
这个时候就是小车在薄到时候我们开
始写作前景开始过咸甜之后小时候就
可以在坡道上面停止然后在显示屏的
一些参数可以大概的再讲一下显示屏
的最后一行视角度的3d是韩式编码器
的数据然后倒数第二行是电池电量电
池的电压当电池电压的一10一点50说
我们建议对电视充电
