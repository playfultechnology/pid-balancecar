Extraction code: 2qng

This "open source" code was supplied by the vendor as a baidu link. The problem is you can't download from baidu without a baidu account, and you can't create a baidu account without supplying a Chinese phone number. So, the workaround is....

Step #1: Go to https://oneleaf.icu/ and enter link and extraction code above

Step #2: Before following the generated download link, you need to edit the "user-agent" property of your browser. In Firefox, go to about:config
Create a new "string" called general.useragent.override with the value "oneleaf"

Now, paste the download link generated by oneleaf and you should be able to download the file via the browser.
